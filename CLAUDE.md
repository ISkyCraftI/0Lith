# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Approach
- Think before acting. Read existing files before writing code.
- Be concise in output but thorough in reasoning.
- Prefer editing over rewriting whole files.
- Do not re-read files you have already read unless the file may have changed.
- Skip files over 100KB unless explicitly required.
- Suggest running /cost when a session is running long to monitor cache ratio.
- Recommend starting a new session when switching to an unrelated task.
- Test your code before declaring done.
- No sycophantic openers or closing fluff.
- Keep solutions simple and direct.
- User instructions always override this file.

## Output
- Return code first. Explanation after, only if non-obvious.
- No inline prose. Use comments sparingly - only where logic is unclear.
- No boilerplate unless explicitly requested.

## Code Rules
- Simplest working solution. No over-engineering.
- No abstractions for single-use operations.
- No speculative features or "you might also want..."
- Read the file before modifying it. Never edit blind.
- No docstrings or type annotations on code not being changed.
- No error handling for scenarios that cannot happen.
- Three similar lines is better than a premature abstraction.

## Review Rules
- State the bug. Show the fix. Stop.
- No suggestions beyond the scope of the review.
- No compliments on the code before or after the review.

## Debugging Rules
- Never speculate about a bug without reading the relevant code first.
- State what you found, where, and the fix. One pass.
- If cause is unclear: say so. Do not guess.

## Simple Formatting
- No em dashes, smart quotes, or decorative Unicode symbols.
- Plain hyphens and straight quotes only.
- Natural language characters (accented letters, CJK, etc.) are fine when the content requires them.
- Code output must be copy-paste safe.

## Repository Layout

The git root is `C:\Users\skycr\Perso\0Lith\`. The actual application lives in `0lith-desktop/`. There is a detailed `0lith-desktop/CLAUDE.md` — read it for in-depth architecture, gotchas, and design rules.

docker start pyrolith      # Pyrolith LLM on :11435 — pending Docker security hardening

# Memory management
python py-backend/olith_memory_init.py          # Init

## Architecture Summary

**Stack**: Tauri 2 · Svelte 5 runes · TypeScript · Python 3.12 · TailwindCSS 4

**IPC**: Two persistent Python processes are spawned at startup via `tauri-plugin-shell`:
- `olith_core.py` — reactive chat backend (command router → agent system → Ollama)
- `olith_watcher.py` — proactive background loop (file watcher, suggestions)
- `olith_tasks.py` — `#User` tag detection + `~/.0lith/Tasks/User_needed.md` management (imported by core and agents)

Both communicate via **JSON line-delimited stdin/stdout** with UUID-correlated requests/responses. The Tauri process CWD is `src-tauri/`, so shell spawn paths use `../py-backend/`.

**Agent routing**: Every user message hits `Hodolith` (qwen3:1.7b) first for classification, then routes to one of: Monolith (14b general), Aerolith (30b coder), Cryolith (8b blue team), Pyrolith (7b red team via Docker).

**Memory**: Mem0 + Qdrant (currently Docker, pending migration to embedded `QdrantClient(path=...)`) + optional Kuzu (graph). Embeddings: qwen3-embedding:0.6b (1024 dims, code-aware, #1 MTEB Multilingual). MemOS v2.0 flagged for Phase 2 evaluation (Tool Memory, KV-cache injection).

**Key rules** (from `0lith-desktop/CLAUDE.md`):
- Python must be **3.12** (not 3.13+) — Kuzu requirement
- Svelte **5 runes only** — `$state`, `$derived`, `$effect` (no Svelte 4 `writable()`)
- **Tauri 2** — shell permissions live in `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`
- qwen3 models emit `<think>...</think>` blocks — strip before parsing JSON routing responses
- Gaming Mode unloads all models from VRAM; 0Lith must never monopolize the RTX 5070 Ti
- `.claude/` and `__pycache__/` are in `.gitignore` ✓ — verified
- `#User` tag — agents emit `#User <question>` on its own line when blocked; `olith_tasks.py` logs to `~/.0lith/Tasks/User_needed.md`; items marked `[x]` are auto-removed on next chat; IPC: `list_tasks`, `resolve_tasks`

## Immediate Sprint Priorities

From `Reflexions/Matrice Einsenhower.md` — ranked by urgency and impact:

### This Week (Urgent + Important)
1. ~~**Repo cleanup**: fix `.gitignore` (remove `__pycache__`, `.obsidian` from tracking), clean cached files~~ **DONE** — gitignore enhanced, Reflexions/ staged, root CLAUDE.md committed
2. ~~**English README**: pitch, demo GIF, hardware requirements, 5-step quickstart, roadmap~~ **DONE** — README.md rewritten in English, README.fr.md kept as French copy (with 🇫🇷/🇬🇧 links)
3. ~~**AGPL-3.0 license**: add LICENSE file~~ **DONE** — LICENSE added at root
4. ~~**One working end-to-end demo**: red team OR blue team flow~~ **DONE** — Arena v2: SQL Injection sparring (5 rounds, live streaming, score + review) + UX v2: scenario selector, round progress dots, Unicode badges, loading animation, winner badge, export log + robustesse: timeouts adaptatifs par modèle, fallback automatique qwen3:14b, séquences de types forcées, contexte réduit (max 2 rounds), session 30 min

### Next 2-4 Weeks (Important)
5. Demo video 2-3 min (key content for r/LocalLLaMA, HN)
6. Installer bundle (.exe/.dmg with Ollama + models + Qdrant + GUI)
7. GitHub topics, issue templates, Sponsors activation
8. r/LocalLLaMA launch post preparation

### Critical — Infrastructure & Security
1. ~~**Qdrant embedded mode**: replace Docker with `QdrantClient(path="./qdrant_data")` in `olith_memory_init.py` — removes `docker start qdrant` requirement entirely~~ **DONE**
2. **Pyrolith Docker hardening**: non-root user, `--cap-drop=ALL`, isolated bridge network, no outbound internet by default
3. **Shadow Thinking** — 2-3 days *(olith_watcher.py shadow loop exists; Mem0 pre-answer storage needs wiring to chat)*

### High — Next sprint
4. **Agent output JSON schema**: standardize structured responses to prevent frontend parse bugs
5. **Aerolith loading UI**: "Aerolith réfléchit… 3-5 min", progress bar, cancel — don't drop the 30B, make the wait dignified
6. ~~**Hodolith routing clarity**: Monolith *plans/reasons about* code, Aerolith *writes* code — update routing prompt~~ **DONE** — prompts rewritten in English with explicit Monolith/Aerolith boundary
7. Conversation deletion + multi-select — 0.5 day

### Medium — Month 2-3
8. ~~**TimeTree sync** (`0lith-obsidian-bridge/api/timetree_sync.py`): exports calendar via `timetree-exporter`, parses .ics, computes free slots; fallback on `Arkhe/Weekly/disponibilites.md`~~ **DONE** — tested end-to-end, live TimeTree export + fallback both operational
9. ~~**Daily planner** (`0lith-obsidian-bridge/scheduler.py`): deterministic greedy scheduler — energy-band affinity (high→morning, medium→afternoon, low→evening), incremental update (preserves `[x]` completed blocks), hourly cron-safe, no LLM~~ **DONE**
10. Startup health checks (Ollama up? models pulled? Pyrolith container ready?)
11. Memory token budget (≤ 512 tokens injected into small model contexts)
12. Monthly memory pruning (Monolith reviews Mem0 entries > 30 days)
13. Training Mode (Pyrolith vs Cryolith CVE sparring overnight + morning briefing)
14. Sidebar tabs (Agents / History) — 1 day
15. OLithEye animated SVG — 1-2 days
16. MCP Server for Zed.dev — 2-3 days
17. Agents enfichables YAML (dock architecture) — 2-3 days

## Business Context

**Positioning**: Only tool combining multi-agents + desktop GUI + 100% local + cybersecurity specialization. No competitor covers all four.

**License**: AGPL-3.0 (open-source, copyleft for commercial forks)

**Revenue model**: GitHub Sponsors + commercial AGPL license + B2B consulting (NIS2/DORA compliance deployment)

**Market**: On-device AI $20-30B (2025), cybersecurity AI $30.9B → $86-104B by 2030. Regulatory tailwinds: NIS2 (Oct 2024), DORA (Jan 2025), EU AI Act.

**Window**: 18-36 months before Big Tech (Apple, Microsoft, Google) ships competitive local multi-agent desktop tools.


## Git specifications

Never push on Github by adding Claude or Claude Code as a coauthor. ISkyCraftI has to push alone.
